Singularity was built for [js13kGames 2018][js13k].

## Inspiration ##

Singularity started out as a digital version of [Escape Pod One][pod] by
[Stephanie Bryant][stephanie]. The sound effects are based on
[tritone paradoxes][tritone], something I learned about from [Primrose][] by
Jason Rohrer.

## Graphics ##

The background graphic is [Starry Night][night] by [Lea Verou][lea].

## Development ##

```bash
npm install
npm run watch
open ./public/index.html
```
